# Multimodal Integrated WebUI App

This web-based application provides a multi-modal user interface that integrates speech, language, and visual understanding to provide a more intuitive and interactive experience. The application uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to analyze and understand speech, text, and images, allowing users to interact with the app in a variety of ways.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you'll need to clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies. You'll also need to obtain API keys for the machine learning services that the app uses, such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Google Cloud Vision, and OpenAI GPT-3.

Once you have your API keys, you can start the app by running the following command:


This will start the app on your local machine, and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

## Using the App

The app provides a variety of features and modes of interaction, including speech recognition, natural language processing, and image recognition. To use these features, simply click on the appropriate button or input field and follow the on-screen instructions.

For example, to use the speech recognition feature, click on the microphone icon and start speaking. The app will transcribe your speech in real-time and display the text on the screen.

To use the natural language processing feature, type in a sentence or phrase in the input field and click the "Analyze" button. The app will use OpenAI GPT-3 to generate a response based on the input.

To use the image recognition feature, upload an image using the file input field or by pasting a URL into the appropriate field. The app will use Google Cloud Vision to analyze the image and provide a description and other relevant information.
